        <h1>Cryptography</h1>
        <p>
            Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. It involves creating and analyzing protocols and algorithms to transform readable information into unreadable formats, which can only be converted back by authorized parties.
            <br><span style=" color: red;">Caesar Cipher</span> : is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It's a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
            <br><span style=" color:red;">RSA Encryption & Decryption</span> : is a widely used public-key cryptographic system that allows secure data transmission. It is based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers and modular arithmetic.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Encryption: A message is encrypted using the recipient's public key, ensuring that only the recipient can decrypt it with their private key.</p>
        <p>Decryption: The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message</p>
